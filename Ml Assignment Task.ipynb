        "Once the algorithm has been chosen, the model is trained on the data. This involves feeding the data into the algorithm and allowing it to learn the relationships between the features and the target variable.

The model can then be used to make predictions on new data, such as customer transactions or sensor readings.\n",

        "The three stages of building a machine learning model are: data preparation, modeling, and deployment. Each stage is important, and the success of the model will depend on the quality of the data, the choice of algorithm, and the accuracy of the predictions."
